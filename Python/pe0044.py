# Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P[n]=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
# 
# 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...
# 
# It can be seen that P[4] + P[7] = 22 + 70 = 92 = P[8]. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.
# 
# Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P[j] and P[k], for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |P[k] − P[j]| is minimised; what is the value of D?
